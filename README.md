## Useful documentation sources
### Event time Timestamps and Watermarks
* [Generating Watermarks (official documentation)](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.html)
* [Builtin Watermark Generators (official documentation)](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_timestamp_extractors.html)

> Both timestamps and watermarks are specified as milliseconds since the Java epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

> Specifying a TimestampAssigner is optional and in most cases you donâ€™t actually want to specify one.  
> For example, when using Kafka or Kinesis you would get timestamps directly from the Kafka/Kinesis records.

> __ReduceFunction and AggregateFunction can be executed more efficiently__ (see State Size section)
> because Flink can incrementally aggregate the elements for each window as they arrive.  
> A ProcessWindowFunction gets an Iterable for all the elements contained in a window 
> and additional meta information about the window to which the elements belong.  
> Therefore, a windowed transformation with a __ProcessWindowFunction cannot be executed as efficiently
> as the other cases__ because Flink has to buffer all elements for a window internally before invoking the function.

> WindowFunction is an older version of ProcessWindowFunction that provides less contextual information and
> does not have some advances features, such as per-window keyed state. This interface will be deprecated at some point.
